Azure Bridge
- Large bridge crossing the bay beside New Azure Harbor.
- Drawbridge that is stuck open when first visited, forcing the player to take the long way around by going north.
- Fixed upon reaching the other side and using Electrify on the bridge controls.
- Is like a Cycling Road and can only be traversed via bike.

Old Azure Harbor
- A sunken city off the coast of New Azure Harbor
- Fell into the bay long ago due to rising sea levels and a terrible and sudden storm.
- Home of a research base that was trying to find a way to help combat the effects of radiation in case of war. Research was complete but not yet public at the time the city sunk to the ocean floor.
- Some of the taller buildings peak out of the water like rocks.
- Explorable via Dive. Optional area. Traversing the area allows the player to find the AntiRad Device key item which makes exploring the Great Crater easier as the player makes the way towards the ending.

Great Crater
- A large crater situated towards the middle of the map.
- Location of the final boss/villain story stuff.
- Can be visited earlier in the game but the player gets the message that the air seems off and they are not allowed to continue.
- Surrounded in a mysterious haze.
- Player navigates this area in late game.
- Weather effect causes monsters to lose HP at the start of each turn. This effect can be negated if the player finds the AntiRad Device in Old Azure Harbor.
- Monsters here are stronger than usual and unaffected by the weather. They are impossible to catch.
- Reaching the bottom is where the villain and legendary are.
- Special Held Item for Enemies in this location - gives a stat boost to every stat when fighting in radiation fog. This item has no effect on monsters from other locations.
- Encounter text changes from "A wild X appears!" to something more sinister. "An X watches you."
