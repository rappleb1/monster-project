History
- Takes place centuries after a war and climate change drastically changed the planet. 
- Life has mostly returned to normal. Radiation and such is why the monsters exist in the world.
- NOT a dystopia and people actually learned from the errors of the past. Not super urbanized, lots of green space and harmony with nature. There are still cities too but not miles and miles of pavement.
- Cars and such are mostly relics of a bygone era. People use monsters and public transport to navigate the world.
